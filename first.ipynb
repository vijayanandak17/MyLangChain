Chat GPT is also based on this model as well.GPT-4 model is released in the early 2023 and it is likely to contain trillions of parameters.GPT-4 Turbo was introduced in late 2023, optimized for speed and cost-efficiency, but its parameter count remains unspecified.How do Large Language Models work?LLMs use the Transformer architecture, which relies on:Input embeddings: Convert words/subwords into vectors.Positional encoding: Adds order information.Self-attention: Learns relationships between tokens.Feed-forward layers: Capture complex interactions.Decoder (for generation): Produces output step-by-step.Multi-head attention: Enables parallel reasoning over different relationships.Architecture of LLMLarge Language Model's (LLM) architecture is determined by a number of factors, like the objective of\\xa0the specific model design, the available computational resources and the kind of language processing tasks that are to be carried out by the LLM. The general architecture of LLM consists of many layers such as the feed forward layers, embedding layers, attention layers. A text which is embedded inside is collaborated together to generate predictions.Important components to influence Large Language Model architecture:Model Size and Parameter Countinput representationsSelf-Attention MechanismsTraining ObjectivesComputational EfficiencyDecoding and Output GenerationTransformer-Based LLM Model ArchitecturesTransformer-based models, which have revolutionized natural language processing tasks, typically follow a general architecture that includes the following components:1. Input Embeddings:\\xa0The input text is tokenized into smaller units, such as words or sub-words and each token is embedded into a continuous vector representation. This embedding step captures the semantic and syntactic information of the input.2. Positional Encoding:\\xa0Positional encoding is added to the input embeddings to provide information about the positions of the tokens because transformers do not naturally encode the order of the tokens. This enables the model to process the tokens while taking their sequential order into account.3. Encoder:\\xa0Based on a neural network technique, the encoder analyses the input text and creates a number of hidden states that protect the context and meaning of text data. Multiple encoder layers make up the core of the transformer architecture. Self-attention mechanism and feed-forward neural network are the two fundamental sub-components of each encoder layer.Self-Attention Mechanism:\\xa0Self-attention enables the model to weigh the importance of different tokens in the input sequence by computing attention scores. It allows the model to consider the dependencies and relationships between different tokens in a context-aware manner.Feed-Forward Neural Network:\\xa0After the self-attention step, a feed-forward neural network is applied to each token independently. This network includes fully connected layers with non-linear activation functions, allowing the model to capture complex interactions between tokens.4. Decoder Layers:\\xa0In some transformer-based models, a decoder component is included in addition to the encoder. The decoder layers enable autoregressive generation, where the model can generate sequential outputs by attending to the previously generated tokens.5. Multi-Head Attention:\\xa0Transformers often employ multi-head attention, where self-attention is performed simultaneously with different learned attention weights. This allows the model to capture different types of relationships and attend to various parts of the input sequence simultaneously.6. Layer Normalization:\\xa0Layer normalization is applied after each sub-component or layer in the transformer architecture. It helps stabilize the learning process and improves the model's ability to generalize across different inputs.7. Output Layers:\\xa0The output layers of the transformer model can vary depending on the specific task. For example, in language modeling, a linear projection followed by SoftMax activation is commonly used to generate the probability distribution over the next token.Popular Large Language Models Now let's look at some of the famous LLMs which has been developed and are up for inference.GPT-4 & GPT-4o (OpenAI): Advanced multimodal reasoning.Gemini 1.5 (Google DeepMind): Long-context reasoning (can process 1M+ tokens).Claude 3 (Anthropic): Safety-focused, strong in reasoning and summarization.LLaMA 3 (Meta): Open-weight model widely used in research & startups.Mistral 7B / Mixtral (Mistral AI): Efficient open-source alternatives.BERT / RoBERTa (Google/Facebook): Strong at embeddings and understanding tasks.mBERT & XLM-R: Early multilingual LLMs (contrary to claims that BLOOM was first).BLOOM: Collaborative open-source multilingual model (but not the first).Large Language Models Use CasesCode Generation: LLMs can generate accurate code based on user instructions for specific tasks.Debugging and Documentation: They assist in identifying code errors, suggesting fixes and even automating project documentation.Question Answering: Users can ask both casual and complex questions, receiving detailed, context-aware responses.Language Translation and Correction: LLMs can translate text between over 50 languages and correct grammatical errors.Prompt-Based Versatility: By crafting creative prompts, users can unlock endless possibilities, as LLMs excel in one-shot and zero-shot learning scenarios. Difference Between NLP and LLM\\xa0NLP is Natural Language Processing, a field of artificial intelligence (AI). It consists of the development of the algorithms. NLP is a broader field than LLM, which consists of algorithms and techniques. NLP rules two approaches i.e. Machine learning and the analyze language data. Applications of NLP are-Automotive routine taskImprove search\\xa0Search engine optimizationAnalyzing and organizing large documentsSocial Media Analytics.while on the other hand, LLM is a Large Language Model and is more specific to human- like text, providing content generation and personalized recommendations.\\xa0Advantages of Large Language ModelsLarge Language Models (LLMs) come with several advantages that contribute to their widespread adoption and success in various applications:LLMs can perform zero-shot learning, meaning they can generalize to tasks for which they were not explicitly trained. This capability allows for adaptability to new applications and scenarios without additional training.LLMs efficiently handle vast amounts of data, making them suitable for tasks that require a deep understanding of extensive text corpora, such as language translation and document summarization.LLMs can be fine-tuned on specific datasets or domains, allowing for continuous learning and adaptation to specific use cases or industries.LLMs enable the automation of various language-related tasks, from code generation to content creation, freeing up human resources for more strategic and complex aspects of a project.Challenges in Training of Large Language ModelsHigh Costs: Training LLMs requires significant financial investment, with millions of dollars needed for large-scale computational power.Time-Intensive: Training takes months, often involving human intervention for fine-tuning to achieve optimal performance.Data Challenges: Obtaining large text datasets is difficult and concerns about the legality of data scraping for commercial purposes have arisen.Environmental Impact: Training a single LLM from scratch can produce carbon emissions equivalent to the lifetime emissions of five cars, raising serious environmental concerns. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\r\\n        Comment\\r\\n    More infoAdvertise with us \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nA\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\nabhishekm482g \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n Follow \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprove\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nArticle Tags : \\n\\n\\nArtificial Intelligence\\n\\n\\ndata-science\\n\\n\\nChatGPT\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nLike\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n864 interested Geeks \\n\\n\\n\\nGATE DA 2028 Online Course [Live Classes] \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n2k+ interested Geeks \\n\\n\\n\\nGATE CS/IT 2028 Complete Course [with Placement Preparation] \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n1k+ interested Geeks \\n\\n\\n\\nGATE CSE + DA 2027 Live Course [with Placement Preparation] \\n\\n\\n\\n\\nExplore\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCorporate & Communications Address:\\n\\r\\n                      A-143, 7th Floor, Sovereign Corporate Tower, Sector- 136, Noida, Uttar Pradesh (201305)                    \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nRegistered Address:\\r\\n                        K 061, Tower K, Gulshan Vivante Apartment, Sector 137, Noida, Gautam Buddh Nagar, Uttar Pradesh, 201305                      \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAdvertise with us\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nCompanyAbout UsLegalPrivacy PolicyCareersContact UsCorporate SolutionCampus Training ProgramExplorePOTDJob-A-ThonConnectCommunityBlogsNation Skill UpTutorialsProgramming LanguagesDSAWeb TechnologyAI, ML & Data ScienceDevOpsCS Core SubjectsInterview PreparationGATESchool SubjectsSoftware and ToolsCoursesIBM CertificationDSA and PlacementsWeb DevelopmentData ScienceProgramming LanguagesDevOps & CloudGATETrending TechnologiesOffline CentersNoidaBengaluruPuneHyderabadPatnaPreparation CornerAptitudePuzzlesGfG 160DSA 360System Design \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n@GeeksforGeeks, Sanchhaya Education Private Limited, All rights reserved\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nImprovement\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuggest changes\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSuggest Changes\\nHelp us improve.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model. During inference, we\\n9\\nTable 4: The Transformer generalizes well to English constituency parsing (Results are on Section 23\\nof WSJ)\\nParser\\nTraining\\nWSJ 23 F1\\nVinyals & Kaiser el al.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds.

In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

We used beam search as described in the previous section, but no\\ncheckpoint averaging. We present these results in Table 3.\\nIn Table 3 rows (A), we vary the number of attention heads and the attention key and value dimensions,\\nkeeping the amount of computation constant, as described in Section 3.2.2. While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

Listing order is random. Jakob proposed replacing RNNs with self-attention and started\\nthe effort to evaluate this idea. Ashish, with Illia, designed and implemented the first Transformer models and\\nhas been crucially involved in every aspect of this work. Noam proposed scaled dot-product attention, multi-head\\nattention and the parameter-free position representation and became the other person involved in nearly every\\ndetail.

Numerous\\nefforts have since continued to push the boundaries of recurrent language models and encoder-decoder\\narchitectures [38, 24, 15].\\nRecurrent models typically factor computation along the symbol positions of the input and output\\nsequences. Aligning the positions to steps in computation time, they generate a sequence of hidden\\nstates ht, as a function of the previous hidden state ht−1 and the input for position t. This inherently\\nsequential nature precludes parallelization within training examples, which becomes critical at longer\\nsequence lengths, as memory constraints limit batching across examples. Recent work has achieved\\nsignificant improvements in computational efficiency through factorization tricks [21] and conditional\\ncomputation [32], while also improving model performance in case of the latter. The fundamental\\nconstraint of sequential computation, however, remains.\\nAttention mechanisms have become an integral part of compelling sequence modeling and transduc-\\ntion models in various tasks, allowing modeling of dependencies without regard to their distance in\\nthe input or output sequences [2, 19]. In all but a few cases [27], however, such attention mechanisms\\nare used in conjunction with a recurrent network.\\nIn this work we propose the Transformer, a model architecture eschewing recurrence and instead\\nrelying entirely on an attention mechanism to draw global dependencies between input and output.\\nThe Transformer allows for significantly more parallelization and can reach a new state of the art in\\ntranslation quality after being trained for as little as twelve hours on eight P100 GPUs.\\n2\\nBackground\\nThe goal of reducing sequential computation also forms the foundation of the Extended Neural GPU\\n[16], ByteNet [18] and ConvS2S [9], all of which use convolutional neural networks as basic building\\nblock, computing hidden representations in parallel for all input and output positions. In these models,\\nthe number of operations required to relate signals from two arbitrary input or output positions grows\\nin the distance between positions, linearly for ConvS2S and logarithmically for ByteNet. This makes\\nit more difficult to learn dependencies between distant positions [12]. In the Transformer this is\\nreduced to a constant number of operations, albeit at the cost of reduced effective resolution due\\nto averaging attention-weighted positions, an effect we counteract with Multi-Head Attention as\\ndescribed in section 3.2.\\nSelf-attention, sometimes called intra-attention is an attention mechanism relating different positions\\nof a single sequence in order to compute a representation of the sequence. Self-attention has been\\nused successfully in a variety of tasks including reading comprehension, abstractive summarization,\\ntextual entailment and learning task-independent sentence representations [4, 27, 28, 22].\\nEnd-to-end memory networks are based on a recurrent attention mechanism instead of sequence-\\naligned recurrence and have been shown to perform well on simple-language question answering and\\nlanguage modeling tasks [34].\\nTo the best of our knowledge, however, the Transformer is the first transduction model relying\\nentirely on self-attention to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-\\naligned RNNs or convolution. In the following sections, we will describe the Transformer, motivate\\nself-attention and discuss its advantages over models such as [17, 18] and [9].\\n3\\nModel Architecture\\nMost competitive neural sequence transduction models have an encoder-decoder structure [5, 2, 35].\\nHere, the encoder maps an input sequence of symbol representations (x1, ..., xn) to a sequence\\nof continuous representations z = (z1, ..., zn). Given z, the decoder then generates an output\\nsequence (y1, ..., ym) of symbols one element at a time. At each step the model is auto-regressive\\n[10], consuming the previously generated symbols as additional input when generating the next.\\n2\\nFigure 1: The Transformer - model architecture.\\nThe Transformer follows this overall architecture using stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully\\nconnected layers for both the encoder and decoder, shown in the left and right halves of Figure 1,\\nrespectively.\\n3.1\\nEncoder and Decoder Stacks\\nEncoder:\\nThe encoder is composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. Each layer has two\\nsub-layers. The first is a multi-head self-attention mechanism, and the second is a simple, position-\\nwise fully connected feed-forward network. We employ a residual connection [11] around each of\\nthe two sub-layers, followed by layer normalization [1]. That is, the output of each sub-layer is\\nLayerNorm(x + Sublayer(x)), where Sublayer(x) is the function implemented by the sub-layer\\nitself. To facilitate these residual connections, all sub-layers in the model, as well as the embedding\\nlayers, produce outputs of dimension dmodel = 512.\\nDecoder:\\nThe decoder is also composed of a stack of N = 6 identical layers. In addition to the two\\nsub-layers in each encoder layer, the decoder inserts a third sub-layer, which performs multi-head\\nattention over the output of the encoder stack. Similar to the encoder, we employ residual connections\\naround each of the sub-layers, followed by layer normalization. We also modify the self-attention\\nsub-layer in the decoder stack to prevent positions from attending to subsequent positions. This\\nmasking, combined with fact that the output embeddings are offset by one position, ensures that the\\npredictions for position i can depend only on the known outputs at positions less than i.\\n3.2\\nAttention\\nAn attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output,\\nwhere the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors. The output is computed as a weighted sum\\n3\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nFigure 2: (left) Scaled Dot-Product Attention. (right) Multi-Head Attention consists of several\\nattention layers running in parallel.\\nof the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the\\nquery with the corresponding key.\\n3.2.1\\nScaled Dot-Product Attention\\nWe call our particular attention \"Scaled Dot-Product Attention\" (Figure 2). The input consists of\\nqueries and keys of dimension dk, and values of dimension dv. We compute the dot products of the\\nquery with all keys, divide each by √dk, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the\\nvalues.\\nIn practice, we compute the attention function on a set of queries simultaneously, packed together\\ninto a matrix Q. The keys and values are also packed together into matrices K and V . We compute\\nthe matrix of outputs as:\\nAttention(Q, K, V ) = softmax(QKT\\n√dk\\n)V\\n(1)\\nThe two most commonly used attention functions are additive attention [2], and dot-product (multi-\\nplicative) attention. Dot-product attention is identical to our algorithm, except for the scaling factor\\nof\\n1\\n√dk . Additive attention computes the compatibility function using a feed-forward network with\\na single hidden layer. While the two are similar in theoretical complexity, dot-product attention is\\nmuch faster and more space-efficient in practice, since it can be implemented using highly optimized\\nmatrix multiplication code.\\nWhile for small values of dk the two mechanisms perform similarly, additive attention outperforms\\ndot product attention without scaling for larger values of dk [3]. We suspect that for large values of\\ndk, the dot products grow large in magnitude, pushing the softmax function into regions where it has\\nextremely small gradients 4. To counteract this effect, we scale the dot products by\\n1\\n√dk .\\n3.2.2\\nMulti-Head Attention\\nInstead of performing a single attention function with dmodel-dimensional keys, values and queries,\\nwe found it beneficial to linearly project the queries, keys and values h times with different, learned\\nlinear projections to dk, dk and dv dimensions, respectively. On each of these projected versions of\\nqueries, keys and values we then perform the attention function in parallel, yielding dv-dimensional\\n4To illustrate why the dot products get large, assume that the components of q and k are independent random\\nvariables with mean 0 and variance 1. Then their dot product, q · k = Pdk\\ni=1 qiki, has mean 0 and variance dk.\\n4\\noutput values. These are concatenated and once again projected, resulting in the final values, as\\ndepicted in Figure 2.\\nMulti-head attention allows the model to jointly attend to information from different representation\\nsubspaces at different positions. With a single attention head, averaging inhibits this.\\nMultiHead(Q, K, V ) = Concat(head1, ..., headh)W O\\nwhere headi = Attention(QW Q\\ni , KW K\\ni , V W V\\ni )\\nWhere the projections are parameter matrices W Q\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W K\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dk, W V\\ni\\n∈Rdmodel×dv\\nand W O ∈Rhdv×dmodel.\\nIn this work we employ h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads. For each of these we use\\ndk = dv = dmodel/h = 64. Due to the reduced dimension of each head, the total computational cost\\nis similar to that of single-head attention with full dimensionality.\\n3.2.3\\nApplications of Attention in our Model\\nThe Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\\n• In \"encoder-decoder attention\" layers, the queries come from the previous decoder layer,\\nand the memory keys and values come from the output of the encoder. This allows every\\nposition in the decoder to attend over all positions in the input sequence. This mimics the\\ntypical encoder-decoder attention mechanisms in sequence-to-sequence models such as\\n[38, 2, 9].\\n• The encoder contains self-attention layers. In a self-attention layer all of the keys, values\\nand queries come from the same place, in this case, the output of the previous layer in the\\nencoder. Each position in the encoder can attend to all positions in the previous layer of the\\nencoder.\\n• Similarly, self-attention layers in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to\\nall positions in the decoder up to and including that position. We need to prevent leftward\\ninformation flow in the decoder to preserve the auto-regressive property. We implement this\\ninside of scaled dot-product attention by masking out (setting to −∞) all values in the input\\nof the softmax which correspond to illegal connections. See Figure 2.\\n3.3\\nPosition-wise Feed-Forward Networks\\nIn addition to attention sub-layers, each of the layers in our encoder and decoder contains a fully\\nconnected feed-forward network, which is applied to each position separately and identically. This\\nconsists of two linear transformations with a ReLU activation in between.\\nFFN(x) = max(0, xW1 + b1)W2 + b2\\n(2)\\nWhile the linear transformations are the same across different positions, they use different parameters\\nfrom layer to layer. Another way of describing this is as two convolutions with kernel size 1.\\nThe dimensionality of input and output is dmodel = 512, and the inner-layer has dimensionality\\ndff = 2048.\\n3.4\\nEmbeddings and Softmax\\nSimilarly to other sequence transduction models, we use learned embeddings to convert the input\\ntokens and output tokens to vectors of dimension dmodel. We also use the usual learned linear transfor-\\nmation and softmax function to convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities. In\\nour model, we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax\\nlinear transformation, similar to [30]. In the embedding layers, we multiply those weights by √dmodel.\\n5\\nTable 1: Maximum path lengths, per-layer complexity and minimum number of sequential operations\\nfor different layer types. n is the sequence length, d is the representation dimension, k is the kernel\\nsize of convolutions and r the size of the neighborhood in restricted self-attention.\\nLayer Type\\nComplexity per Layer\\nSequential\\nMaximum Path Length\\nOperations\\nSelf-Attention\\nO(n2 · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(1)\\nRecurrent\\nO(n · d2)\\nO(n)\\nO(n)\\nConvolutional\\nO(k · n · d2)\\nO(1)\\nO(logk(n))\\nSelf-Attention (restricted)\\nO(r · n · d)\\nO(1)\\nO(n/r)\\n3.5\\nPositional Encoding\\nSince our model contains no recurrence and no convolution, in order for the model to make use of the\\norder of the sequence, we must inject some information about the relative or absolute position of the\\ntokens in the sequence. To this end, we add \"positional encodings\" to the input embeddings at the\\nbottoms of the encoder and decoder stacks. The positional encodings have the same dimension dmodel\\nas the embeddings, so that the two can be summed. There are many choices of positional encodings,\\nlearned and fixed [9].\\nIn this work, we use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies:\\nPE(pos,2i) = sin(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nPE(pos,2i+1) = cos(pos/100002i/dmodel)\\nwhere pos is the position and i is the dimension. That is, each dimension of the positional encoding\\ncorresponds to a sinusoid. The wavelengths form a geometric progression from 2π to 10000 · 2π. We\\nchose this function because we hypothesized it would allow the model to easily learn to attend by\\nrelative positions, since for any fixed offset k, PEpos+k can be represented as a linear function of\\nPEpos.\\nWe also experimented with using learned positional embeddings [9] instead, and found that the two\\nversions produced nearly identical results (see Table 3 row (E)). We chose the sinusoidal version\\nbecause it may allow the model to extrapolate to sequence lengths longer than the ones encountered\\nduring training.\\n4\\nWhy Self-Attention\\nIn this section we compare various aspects of self-attention layers to the recurrent and convolu-\\ntional layers commonly used for mapping one variable-length sequence of symbol representations\\n(x1, ..., xn) to another sequence of equal length (z1, ..., zn), with xi, zi ∈Rd, such as a hidden\\nlayer in a typical sequence transduction encoder or decoder. Motivating our use of self-attention we\\nconsider three desiderata.\\nOne is the total computational complexity per layer. Another is the amount of computation that can\\nbe parallelized, as measured by the minimum number of sequential operations required.\\nThe third is the path length between long-range dependencies in the network. Learning long-range\\ndependencies is a key challenge in many sequence transduction tasks. One key factor affecting the\\nability to learn such dependencies is the length of the paths forward and backward signals have to\\ntraverse in the network. The shorter these paths between any combination of positions in the input\\nand output sequences, the easier it is to learn long-range dependencies [12]. Hence we also compare\\nthe maximum path length between any two input and output positions in networks composed of the\\ndifferent layer types.\\nAs noted in Table 1, a self-attention layer connects all positions with a constant number of sequentially\\nexecuted operations, whereas a recurrent layer requires O(n) sequential operations. In terms of\\ncomputational complexity, self-attention layers are faster than recurrent layers when the sequence\\n6\\nlength n is smaller than the representation dimensionality d, which is most often the case with\\nsentence representations used by state-of-the-art models in machine translations, such as word-piece\\n[38] and byte-pair [31] representations. To improve computational performance for tasks involving\\nvery long sequences, self-attention could be restricted to considering only a neighborhood of size r in\\nthe input sequence centered around the respective output position. This would increase the maximum\\npath length to O(n/r). We plan to investigate this approach further in future work.\\nA single convolutional layer with kernel width k < n does not connect all pairs of input and output\\npositions. Doing so requires a stack of O(n/k) convolutional layers in the case of contiguous kernels,\\nor O(logk(n)) in the case of dilated convolutions [18], increasing the length of the longest paths\\nbetween any two positions in the network. Convolutional layers are generally more expensive than\\nrecurrent layers, by a factor of k. Separable convolutions [6], however, decrease the complexity\\nconsiderably, to O(k · n · d + n · d2). Even with k = n, however, the complexity of a separable\\nconvolution is equal to the combination of a self-attention layer and a point-wise feed-forward layer,\\nthe approach we take in our model.\\nAs side benefit, self-attention could yield more interpretable models. We inspect attention distributions\\nfrom our models and present and discuss examples in the appendix. Not only do individual attention\\nheads clearly learn to perform different tasks, many appear to exhibit behavior related to the syntactic\\nand semantic structure of the sentences.\\n5\\nTraining\\nThis section describes the training regime for our models.\\n5.1\\nTraining Data and Batching\\nWe trained on the standard WMT 2014 English-German dataset consisting of about 4.5 million\\nsentence pairs. Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding [3], which has a shared source-\\ntarget vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. For English-French, we used the significantly larger WMT\\n2014 English-French dataset consisting of 36M sentences and split tokens into a 32000 word-piece\\nvocabulary [38]. Sentence pairs were batched together by approximate sequence length. Each training\\nbatch contained a set of sentence pairs containing approximately 25000 source tokens and 25000\\ntarget tokens.\\n5.2\\nHardware and Schedule\\nWe trained our models on one machine with 8 NVIDIA P100 GPUs. For our base models using\\nthe hyperparameters described throughout the paper, each training step took about 0.4 seconds. We\\ntrained the base models for a total of 100,000 steps or 12 hours. For our big models,(described on the\\nbottom line of table 3), step time was 1.0 seconds. The big models were trained for 300,000 steps\\n(3.5 days).\\n5.3\\nOptimizer\\nWe used the Adam optimizer [20] with β1 = 0.9, β2 = 0.98 and ϵ = 10−9. We varied the learning\\nrate over the course of training, according to the formula:\\nlrate = d−0.5\\nmodel · min(step_num−0.5, step_num · warmup_steps−1.5)\\n(3)\\nThis corresponds to increasing the learning rate linearly for the first warmup_steps training steps,\\nand decreasing it thereafter proportionally to the inverse square root of the step number. We used\\nwarmup_steps = 4000.\\n5.4\\nRegularization\\nWe employ three types of regularization during training:\\n7\\nTable 2: The Transformer achieves better BLEU scores than previous state-of-the-art models on the\\nEnglish-to-German and English-to-French newstest2014 tests at a fraction of the training cost.\\nModel\\nBLEU\\nTraining Cost (FLOPs)\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nEN-DE\\nEN-FR\\nByteNet [18]\\n23.75\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk [39]\\n39.2\\n1.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL [38]\\n24.6\\n39.92\\n2.3 · 1019\\n1.4 · 1020\\nConvS2S [9]\\n25.16\\n40.46\\n9.6 · 1018\\n1.5 · 1020\\nMoE [32]\\n26.03\\n40.56\\n2.0 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1020\\nDeep-Att + PosUnk Ensemble [39]\\n40.4\\n8.0 · 1020\\nGNMT + RL Ensemble [38]\\n26.30\\n41.16\\n1.8 · 1020\\n1.1 · 1021\\nConvS2S Ensemble [9]\\n26.36\\n41.29\\n7.7 · 1019\\n1.2 · 1021\\nTransformer (base model)\\n27.3\\n38.1\\n3.3 · 1018\\nTransformer (big)\\n28.4\\n41.8\\n2.3 · 1019\\nResidual Dropout\\nWe apply dropout [33] to the output of each sub-layer, before it is added to the\\nsub-layer input and normalized. In addition, we apply dropout to the sums of the embeddings and the\\npositional encodings in both the encoder and decoder stacks. For the base model, we use a rate of\\nPdrop = 0.1.\\nLabel Smoothing\\nDuring training, we employed label smoothing of value ϵls = 0.1 [36]. This\\nhurts perplexity, as the model learns to be more unsure, but improves accuracy and BLEU score.\\n6\\nResults\\n6.1\\nMachine Translation\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-German translation task, the big transformer model (Transformer (big)\\nin Table 2) outperforms the best previously reported models (including ensembles) by more than 2.0\\nBLEU, establishing a new state-of-the-art BLEU score of 28.4. The configuration of this model is\\nlisted in the bottom line of Table 3. Training took 3.5 days on 8 P100 GPUs. Even our base model\\nsurpasses all previously published models and ensembles, at a fraction of the training cost of any of\\nthe competitive models.\\nOn the WMT 2014 English-to-French translation task, our big model achieves a BLEU score of 41.0,\\noutperforming all of the previously published single models, at less than 1/4 the training cost of the\\nprevious state-of-the-art model. The Transformer (big) model trained for English-to-French used\\ndropout rate Pdrop = 0.1, instead of 0.3.\\nFor the base models, we used a single model obtained by averaging the last 5 checkpoints, which\\nwere written at 10-minute intervals. For the big models, we averaged the last 20 checkpoints. We\\nused beam search with a beam size of 4 and length penalty α = 0.6 [38]. These hyperparameters\\nwere chosen after experimentation on the development set. We set the maximum output length during\\ninference to input length + 50, but terminate early when possible [38].\\nTable 2 summarizes our results and compares our translation quality and training costs to other model\\narchitectures from the literature. We estimate the number of floating point operations used to train a\\nmodel by multiplying the training time, the number of GPUs used, and an estimate of the sustained\\nsingle-precision floating-point capacity of each GPU 5.\\n6.2\\nModel Variations\\nTo evaluate the importance of different components of the Transformer, we varied our base model\\nin different ways, measuring the change in performance on English-to-German translation on the\\n5We used values of 2.8, 3.7, 6.0 and 9.5 TFLOPS for K80, K40, M40 and P100, respectively.\\n8\\nTable 3: Variations on the Transformer architecture.

While single-head\\nattention is 0.9 BLEU worse than the best setting, quality also drops off with too many heads.\\nIn Table 3 rows (B), we observe that reducing the attention key size dk hurts model quality. This\\nsuggests that determining compatibility is not easy and that a more sophisticated compatibility\\nfunction than dot product may be beneficial. We further observe in rows (C) and (D) that, as expected,\\nbigger models are better, and dropout is very helpful in avoiding over-fitting. In row (E) we replace our\\nsinusoidal positional encoding with learned positional embeddings [9], and observe nearly identical\\nresults to the base model.\\n6.3\\nEnglish Constituency Parsing\\nTo evaluate if the Transformer can generalize to other tasks we performed experiments on English\\nconstituency parsing. This task presents specific challenges: the output is subject to strong structural\\nconstraints and is significantly longer than the input. Furthermore, RNN sequence-to-sequence\\nmodels have not been able to attain state-of-the-art results in small-data regimes [37].\\nWe trained a 4-layer transformer with dmodel = 1024 on the Wall Street Journal (WSJ) portion of the\\nPenn Treebank [25], about 40K training sentences. We also trained it in a semi-supervised setting,\\nusing the larger high-confidence and BerkleyParser corpora from with approximately 17M sentences\\n[37]. We used a vocabulary of 16K tokens for the WSJ only setting and a vocabulary of 32K tokens\\nfor the semi-supervised setting.\\nWe performed only a small number of experiments to select the dropout, both attention and residual\\n(section 5.4), learning rates and beam size on the Section 22 development set, all other parameters\\nremained unchanged from the English-to-German base translation model.

On both WMT 2014 English-to-German and WMT 2014\\nEnglish-to-French translation tasks, we achieve a new state of the art. In the former task our best\\nmodel outperforms even all previously reported ensembles.\\nWe are excited about the future of attention-based models and plan to apply them to other tasks. We\\nplan to extend the Transformer to problems involving input and output modalities other than text and\\nto investigate local, restricted attention mechanisms to efficiently handle large inputs and outputs\\nsuch as images, audio and video. Making generation less sequential is another research goals of ours.\\nThe code we used to train and evaluate our models is available at https://github.com/\\ntensorflow/tensor2tensor.\\nAcknowledgements\\nWe are grateful to Nal Kalchbrenner and Stephan Gouws for their fruitful\\ncomments, corrections and inspiration.\\nReferences\\n[1] Jimmy Lei Ba, Jamie Ryan Kiros, and Geoffrey E Hinton.

This milestone signals that\\nAI VTubers have entered mainstream recognition. For HCI and media studies, it raises an urgent question: when the\\n“performer” is an AI system, do audiences engage in ways continuous with human VTuber cultures [8, 35, 46, 57], or do\\nnew dynamics emerge that reshape how participation, authenticity, and monetization are experienced?\\nVTubers are online performers who use avatars in livestreams, blending authenticity and performance [27]. AI\\nVTubers (Fig.1) represent a distinct subset whose dialogue and behavior are generated primarily by large language\\nmodels (LLMs) or related generative systems, rather than by a human performer. Prior work has examined AI in\\nlivestreaming primarily as a tool for commerce [4, 23, 34, 59, 62, 64, 66] or as supportive assistance to human streamers\\n[17, 40]. Other work has explored technical feasibility through prototypes such as Bilibug [32] or KawAIi [1]. What\\nremains missing is an account of fully autonomous, LLM-driven entertainers: why humans are drawn to them, how\\nparasocial bonds and community identities form when the agent is visibly non-human, and what economic logics\\nstabilize around such engagements. Technical feasibility [6, 60] explains that an AI VTuber can exist, but it does not\\nexplain why audiences stay, attach, and pay.\\nIn this context, studying AI VTubers carries both theoretical and practical significance. Theoretically, it pushes media\\nand HCI scholarship to revisit foundational concepts of participation, authenticity, and fan economy in contexts where\\nperformers are not human. Practically, it surfaces design challenges for AI-mediated entertainment: balancing fairness\\nwith monetization, ensuring persona stability without losing unpredictability, and addressing risks of over-attachment.\\n1https://www.twitch.tv/vedal987\\n1\\narXiv:2509.10427v1  [cs.HC]  12 Sep 2025\\n2\\nYe, et al.\\n(a) Chats\\n(b) SuperChat\\n(c) AI VTuber Neuro-sama’s \\nLive2d avatar\\n(d) Live captions of Neuro-sama\\'s speech\\nFig. 1.

These elements illustrate\\nhow real-time audience interaction, paid prompts, and AI-driven performance combine in the AI VTuber experience.\\nThese stakes underline the urgency of treating AI VTubers not as a curiosity, but as a testbed for broader questions\\nabout human-AI intimacy and platform economies.\\nTo address this gap, we conducted an in-depth investigation of the fan community surrounding Neuro-sama, one of\\nthe most prominent AI VTubers [53]. We focused on the following research questions (RQs):\\n⊲RQ1: How do audiences discover AI VTubers, and what motivates initial attraction?\\n⊲RQ2: How do fans construct parasocial relationships and shared community cultures around AI VTubers?\\n⊲RQ3: What drives fans to provide financial support to AI VTubers?\\nFigure 2 shows our multi-phase qualitative design that strategically combined complementary methods to capture\\nbreadth, depth, and behavioral validation. We first conducted a survey with 334 Neuro-sama fans to capture broad\\nmotivations and engagement patterns, followed by semi-structured interviews with 12 dedicated fans to probe\\nparasocial bonds and community meanings, and finally a log analysis of livestream interaction to examine co-\\ncreative practices and financial support behaviors. This triangulated design strengthened the credibility of our findings\\nand yielded a comprehensive account of engagement with AI VTubers.\\nOur findings show that (1) audiences are initially attracted by the unpredictability and improvisational quality of\\ncommunity-AI interaction, (2) they construct a new form of parasocial relationship where consistency rather than\\nhumanness anchors authenticity, and (3) they financially support AI VTubers not only to express recognition but to\\npurchase opportunities for real-time co-performance.

Finally, these dynamics foreground\\ndesign and policy challenges: how to balance openness with revenue, how to engineer persona stability without\\nsuppressing improvisation, and how to mitigate risks of psychological over-attachment.\\nOur primary contributions include:\\n⊲We present the first systematic study of a fan community centered on a fully AI-driven VTuber, combining\\nsurveys, interviews, and log analysis to map the pathway from initial discovery to sustained loyalty, thereby\\nextending VTuber scholarship into non-human performers.\\n⊲We extend theories of parasocial interaction, authenticity, and participatory culture by conceptualizing consistency-\\nas-authenticity and real-time co-performance commodification, showing how fans reconcile technical awareness\\nwith emotional projection and how monetization reconfigures participation.\\n⊲We distill design implications for future AI-mediated entertainment: balancing fairness with revenue, engineering\\npersona consistency while retaining improvisational appeal, and embedding safeguards against parasocial\\nover-attachment.\\n2\\nRelated Work\\n2.1\\nVTubers in HCI\\nVirtual YouTubers (VTubers) are livestreamers who perform through virtual avatars, while the human performer behind\\nthe avatar is referred to as Nakanohito. Since Kizuna Ai’s debut in 2016 [25], VTubing has become one of the most\\nprevalent forms of streaming, particularly among audiences who value anime-inspired aesthetics. By December 2022,\\nmore than 20,000 VTubers were active worldwide [51], with the most popular ones amassing more than four million\\nfollowers [52].HCI researchers have approached this phenomenon from three angles.\\n4\\nYe, et al.\\nOne body of work examines the design of VTubers themselves. Studies investigate how VTubers construct their\\navatars and identities, including the role of gender expression [3, 54], cross-cultural aesthetics [42], and inclusive\\nrepresentation [41]. Others examine the production side, such as the tools and environments used for VTubing [24].\\nThese studies highlight how technical and aesthetic choices shape the mediated presence of VTubers.\\nA complementary stream focuses on the relationship between VTubers and their fans. Research shows that these\\nbonds are best understood through parasocial interaction [46], where fans construct deep emotional ties to performers.\\nSuch connections can provide comfort and companionship [8, 35], but they also leave fans vulnerable to emotional\\ndisruption when streamers retire or go on hiatus [27]. Fan practices extend beyond individual attachment to collective\\nactivities (e.g., concerts and shared rituals) that reinforce community identity [28].\\nFinally, researchers have investigated the economic infrastructures that sustain VTuber communities. Scholars\\ndocument how subscription models build long-term loyalty [44], while virtual gift-giving serves as a social signal that\\nenhances fan visibility and status [30, 31]. Recent work also examines platform-specific monetization tools such as\\nSuperchat [63, 65], showing how fans use highlighted paid messages not only for recognition but also as a means of\\nparticipation in livestreams. These studies show that financial support functions as a social practice within VTuber\\nfandoms, rather than as a simple transaction.\\nThis extensive body of work on human VTubers provides a strong foundation, but it leaves open questions of\\nhow these dynamics unfold when the performer is not human. Existing scholarship has richly theorized avatars, fan\\nrelationships, and monetization in human-led contexts, yet we still lack understanding of how these frameworks extend\\nwhen the “performer” is an AI agent. Our work takes up this challenge by using Neuro-sama as a case to examine how\\nhuman–AI interaction reshapes parasociality, participation, and platform economies.\\n2.2\\nAI Applications in Livestreaming\\nScholars have increasingly examined how AI is being integrated into livestreaming, with most research concentrating\\non e-commerce contexts. Early work compared AI streamers with human hosts and found that virtual agents can\\nperform competitively in commercial settings [61, 62]. Subsequent studies demonstrated that AI agents can actively\\nshape purchasing decisions [4, 34] and even influence the broader dynamics of digital commerce [59]. Beyond functional\\nperformance, anthropomorphic design features [5] and subtle emotional cues such as smiling [14, 23] have been shown\\nto strengthen consumer engagement. These studies suggest that the effectiveness of AI streamers depends not only on\\nwhat they do, but also on how human-like and emotionally expressive they appear.\\nA second line of work explores AI as supportive technology for human streamers. For example, commercial livestream\\nassistants can provide interactive support during broadcasts [55], while personality-infused AI companions can enhance\\naudience connection [17]. Other systems enable cross-language interactions through real-time translation [47]. Yet\\nthese applications face clear limitations: weaknesses in sensory language can undermine perceived authenticity [21],\\nand service failures can trigger consumer disengagement [38]. This literature illustrates both the supportive potential\\nand the persistent challenges of AI in livestreaming environments.\\nBy contrast, research on entertainment-oriented AI streamers is still sparse. Prior studies examined technical\\nintegrations of AI into VTubers [60] or the role of digital human technologies in social media livestreaming [6], but\\nlittle attention has been paid to fully autonomous AI VTubers that function as entertainers in their own right. The\\nrise of fully autonomous AI VTubers like Neuro-sama foregrounds not just technical feasibility but also questions of\\naudience engagement, parasociality, and collective identity. Our study addresses this underexplored dimension of AI in\\nlivestreaming by shifting the focus from commerce and assistance to entertainment and community-building.\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n5\\n2.3\\nTheoretical Lenses on Participation and Authenticity\\nBeyond prior empirical work on VTubers and AI streamers, we also turn to theoretical traditions. In particular,\\nparticipatory culture and mediated authenticity provide valuable lenses for interpreting how fan practices change when\\nthe performer is an AI system.\\nJenkins’ theory of participatory culture characterizes audiences as active contributors who remix, circulate, and\\nco-create media rather than consume passively [22]. In the VTuber context, this is evident in fan remixes, meme\\ncirculation, and event participation [28]. Critical scholarship, however, has emphasized that such participation is never\\npurely empowering: platforms often commodify it, turning fans’ creative labor into monetized value streams [16, 50].\\nThis tension between agency and commodification is central to our inquiry, raising the question of whether real-time\\ninteractions (e.g., paid prompts) simply extend participatory culture or signal a shift toward new forms of monetized\\nco-performance.\\nAuthenticity is a second anchor in understanding mediated relationships. Enli frames authenticity as a negotiated\\nachievement between audiences and media figures [12], while parasocial interaction theory conceptualizes how\\naudiences build one-sided bonds with media characters “as if” they were real partners [45]. In human VTubing,\\nauthenticity often hinges on the fragile boundary between the avatar persona and the human performer (Nakanohito)\\nbehind it [35]. AI VTubers, by contrast, have no such backstage, raising questions about how authenticity is redefined\\nwhen the performer is visibly non-human.\\nThese theoretical perspectives highlight why AI VTubers provide a distinctive case for HCI and media studies. They\\nallow us to ask not only how audiences adopt AI-driven performers, but also how participation, authenticity, and\\nparasociality must be re-examined when the performer is an artificial agent. In particular, they offer an opportunity to\\ntest and extend classic frameworks under conditions where non-humanness is not hidden but made explicit.\\n3\\nMethod\\nTo comprehensively investigate AI VTuber fans’ formation, preservation, and financial activities, we adopted a research\\ndesign primarily rooted in qualitative inquiry. We selected Neuro-sama as our representative AI VTuber subject because\\nit is the most prominent AI VTuber, substantially surpassing other AI VTubers in follower count2. Furthermore, Neuro-\\nsama maintains a significant fan base on both the Twitch and Bilibili platforms, broadcasting simultaneously in English\\nand Chinese, which enables coverage of VTuber fans from diverse cultural backgrounds.\\nAs shown in Figure 2, the research was conducted in three sequential stages3. First, to establish a broad, foundational\\nunderstanding across all three RQs, we conducted a large-scale qualitative survey. This initial stage allowed us\\nto identify the key motivations, relational dynamics, and financial drivers within the broad fan community. Next, to\\nexplore the in-depth personal narratives and emotional experiences that contextualize the survey findings, we conducted\\nsupplementary semi-structured interview with fans, providing insight into how dedicated fans make meaning\\nof their relationship with Neuro-sama. Finally, to compare these self-reported perceptions with real-time behaviors,\\nwe performed an analysis of livestream interaction log data, including Chats and Superchats. This allowed us to\\nobserve how fans interact and provide financial support in real-time, and to contrast these behaviors with those seen in\\nhuman VTuber communities (discussed in subsubsection 3.3.1).\\n2https://virtual-youtuber.userlocal.jp/office/aivtuber.\\n3This research protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board (IRB).\\n6\\nYe, et al.\\n3.1\\nSurvey\\nWe conducted a large-scale survey among Neuro-sama’s fans to understand their engagement motivations, perceived\\nrelationship with Neuro-sama, and direct reasons for financial support.\\n3.1.1\\nParticipants and Recruitment. To ensure 1) all participants were genuine Neuro-sama fans qualified to provide\\nrelevant insights for our study, and 2) the participants represented diverse backgrounds and communities, we imple-\\nmented a careful recruitment strategy. Specifically, we recruited participants through a public call for participation\\ndistributed via social media fan groups for Neuro-sama (e.g., Discord, QQ–a widely used Chinese messaging and\\nsocial media platform similar to WhatsApp), public social media platforms, and personal contacts. An initial screening\\nquestion confirmed that all respondents had watched Neuro-sama’s streams (e.g., “Do you watch the AI-driven VTuber,\\nNeuro-sama? ”). As compensation for survey participation, we randomly selected three respondents to receive an official\\nNeuro-sama plush toy ($29.99 each). The selection of this compensation was intentional, as it would primarily appeal to\\nthose familiar with Neuro-sama’s content, thus helping to ensure authentic participation from dedicated fans rather\\nthan casual respondents.\\nUltimately, we collected 334 valid responses. The sample demonstrated high engagement with Neuro-sama: over\\nhalf of the participants (52.69%) reported watching Neuro-sama’s streams or related videos almost daily, and a total of\\n77.24% watched at least three times a week. The sample was nearly evenly split between experienced and new VTuber\\nviewers; 48.8% were regular viewers of human VTubers before watching Neuro-sama, while the other 51.2% were new\\nto the VTuber space.\\n3.1.2\\nSurvey Instrument. As shown in Appendix A, the survey questionnaire was designed to address our three research\\nquestions (RQs). For RQ1, it included questions on discovery channels, initial motivations, perceived differences\\nbetween supporting AI or human VTubers, and fan conversion factors. For RQ2, it incorporated a Parasocial\\nInteraction (PSI) scale [45], questions on relationship definition, and prompts about community memes. Finally,\\nfor RQ3, it investigated payment frequency and motivations. The survey instrument consisted of single-choice,\\nmultiple-choice, matrix-style, and open-ended questions.\\n3.1.3\\nMeasures. For all open-ended questions, we conducted a thematic analysis of the responses. Responses to the\\nquestion, “Was there a specific moment or interaction that made you decide to become a regular viewer instead of just\\na casual one? If so, describe it.” were particularly complex. For this question, we used a two-stage coding process to\\nensure accuracy. This approach follows established practices in thematic analysis [2]. First, an author familiar with the\\nNeuro-sama fan community conducted an initial round of coding to generate a set of granular, initial codes. Following\\nthis, three authors discussed and consolidated these initial codes into second-level themes and then calculated the\\nfrequency of each theme.\\nFor closed-ended questions, we conducted descriptive statistical analyses by computing the frequency and percentage\\nof each option, a common approach for analyzing survey response distributions [15]. These summaries helped us\\ncompare the relative popularity of different options and examine the distribution of choices among participants.\\nAll elements of our PSI scale were measured in a five-point Likert-style (1 = Strongly Disagree; 5 = Strongly Agree).\\nThe design of our scale was informed by the PSI Process Scales [45] and prior research on PSI scales for VTuber fans\\n[46]. It comprised 12 items across three dimensions (4 items per dimension):\\n⊲Cognitive (e.g., “I pay close attention to Neuro-sama’s behaviors and response patterns.”)\\n⊲Affective (e.g., “Watching Neuro-sama’s streams makes me feel relaxed and comfortable.”)\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n7\\n⊲Behavioral (e.g., “During a stream, I often feel the urge to ask Neuro-sama a question or express my opinion via\\nChat or a SuperChat.”)\\nWe assessed internal consistency using Cronbach’s alpha [49]. Reliability was calculated for each dimension: cognitive\\n(𝛼= 0.69), affective (𝛼= 0.71), and behavioral (𝛼= 0.76). Averaging across the three yielded an overall reliability of\\n𝛼= 0.72, indicating good consistency.\\n3.2\\nInterview\\nAfter completing our survey analysis, we identified several questions that required more detailed qualitative exploration\\nand evidentiary support. Consequently, we designed supplementary semi-structured interviews to investigate these\\nambiguous findings in depth, uncover personal experiences and complex emotions of core fans, and provide rich\\nqualitative interpretations and contextual narratives to complement our quantitative data.\\n3.2.1\\nInterviewee Recruitment. We distributed interview recruitment information through the same channels used for\\nour survey in 3.1, seeking dedicated Neuro-sama fans who preferably had experience watching human VTubers. The\\ninterview lasted 20-30 minutes, and as compensation, participants will receive a one-month Twitch subscription to Neuro-\\nsama ($4.99, used to support the streamer) or may choose to receive an equivalent cash amount. This compensation\\nmethod helps us identify dedicated Neuro-sama fans for our study. We recruited 12 participants who met these criteria.\\nAs shown in Table 1, the interviewees represented diverse backgrounds in terms of gender, age, professional experience,\\nand cultural background. Most were deeply engaged fans with long-term, high-frequency viewing habits, and the\\nmajority had prior experience watching human VTubers. The participant pool was predominantly male and students,\\naligning with demographic patterns noted in previous VTuber audience research [35]. Notably, three participants\\nexplicitly identified as core fans who had engaged in high-involvement community activities such as creating fan art\\nand clipping stream highlights.\\nTable 1.

We conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 Neuro-sama fans via text or voice commu-\\nnication. For voice interviews, we first manually anonymized portions of the audio to remove identifying references,\\nand then submitted the processed recordings to the Gemini-2.5-Pro model for transcription. The resulting transcripts\\nwere subsequently provided to participants for confirmation. Interviews were conducted in the participant’s native\\nlanguage (either Chinese or English). The content primarily explored three themes: unexpected entertainment effects\\nunique to AI streaming, the significance of Neuro-sama’s absence of a Nakanohito, and emotional and personality\\nperceptions—areas that complemented our previous survey analysis. During the interviews, we posed questions related\\nto these themes, such as asking participants to recall surprising moments from Neuro-sama’s streams and whether they\\nbelieved Neuro-sama possessed “real” emotions.\\n3.2.3\\nInterview Data Analysis. We conducted an open-coding analysis [2] of the interview transcripts. Two authors\\nindependently coded the transcripts of three participants (out of twelve) using MAXQDA4 to identify initial codes.\\nThe coders then met to compare their coding outcomes, discussed discrepancies, and refined the coding scheme into a\\nunified codebook. With this finalized codebook, they analyzed the remaining transcripts, keeping close communication\\nthroughout to resolve ambiguities and update the codebook when necessary. This iterative discussion-based procedure\\nensured consistency in coding and supported the validity of the resulting themes. The complete codebook is provided\\nin Appendix B.\\n3.3\\nInteraction Logs Analysis\\nTo delve deeper into RQ2 (parasocial relationships and community culture) and RQ3 (motivations for financial support),\\nwe analyzed live-stream interaction logs. Specifically, these logs contain the complete record of audience engagement\\nthrough Chat and SuperChat messages. Chat messages are the standard, real-time comments sent by viewers, which\\nappear chronologically and move quickly in a continuous stream. In contrast, SuperChat is a feature that allows viewers\\nto purchase highlighted messages that are pinned or displayed prominently in the livestream chat, ensuring the streamer\\nsees them. As these two forms represent the most direct modes of engagement, analyzing them provides critical insight\\ninto fan behavior.\\n3.3.1\\nData Collection. We selected Neuro-sama as our main analysis subject. To establish appropriate human VTuber\\ncontrol groups, we surveyed recently active VTubers on Twitch with substantial follower counts, filtering for those\\nwith similar streaming styles and content to Neuro-sama. Our selection criteria included:\\nInclusion criteria:\\n⊲Stream primarily on Twitch platform with English as the main broadcasting language\\n⊲Female virtual avatar with female performer\\n⊲Recently active with streaming viewership exceeding 10k\\n⊲Content primarily focused on ’Just Chatting’ category with streaming style similar to Neuro-sama (lively and\\nplayful)\\n⊲At least one author is familiar with the VTuber’s streaming style and background information.\\nExclusion criteria:\\n⊲Recently involved in controversies (e.g., graduation, financial disputes, etc.)\\n4https://www.maxqda.com/\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n9\\nTable 2.

Both stream on Twitch\\nwith comparable content styles to Neuro-sama, focusing primarily on conversational streams with similar audience\\nsizes.\\nTo enable a standardized comparison, we selected a representative sample of broadcasts: eight streams from Neuro-\\nsama, eight from Camila, and six from Filian (approximately 20-23 hours each). Each stream was manually vetted to\\nensure it was a typical “Just Chatting” broadcast, free of special events or external controversies that could skew data.\\nThis deliberate selection was essential for comparing baseline interactive patterns and the stability of their economic\\nsupport under comparable conditions.\\nFor data extraction, we utilized the open-source TwitchDownloader tool7 to collect data from the channels of these\\nVTubers. We gathered stream Video on Demand(VOD) records along with all publicly available Chat and SuperChat\\nlogs for each broadcast, ensuring our collection rates complied with platform guidelines. The VOD records included\\ntitle, duration, collection timestamp, streamer identification, and video footage. Chat records encompassed sending\\ntime, anonymized sender ID, message content, user badges, and corresponding stream session. SuperChat records\\ncontained sending time, anonymized sender ID, message content, bits spent, USD amount, badges, subscription status,\\nand associated stream session. All user IDs were irreversibly hashed during collection to ensure anonymity, preventing\\nany research team member from accessing original sender identities. The details of our collected data can be referenced\\nin Table 2.\\n3.3.2\\nChat Analysis. For chat analysis, given the substantial volume of data, we employed an LLM-based coding\\napproach, a method increasingly adopted for large-scale qualitative coding due to its efficiency and scalability [7, 56, 58].\\nTo first establish a reliable coding scheme, we applied simple rule-based filtering to eliminate meaningless emoticons and\\ntext fragments. Subsequently, an initial set of one hundred chat messages was randomly sampled from each VTuber’s\\nstream for iterative human coding, which informed the development of our final categories. The detailed coding scheme\\ncan be found in Table 3, with difficult-to-classify or meaningless content that escaped initial filtering categorized as\\nN/A. We then utilized the GPT-4.1-mini model to classify and encode all remaining chat messages, with the complete\\nprompt provided in the Appendix E.\\nTo validate the reliability of the LLM-based coding, we conducted a rigorous human evaluation [19, 48]. Specifically,\\na second, distinct set of 100 chat messages with their corresponding LLM coding results was randomly selected from\\neach VTuber’s dataset for independent human coding. After completing this process, we calculated Cohen’s Kappa\\n[9] coefficients to assess the inter-rater agreement between the human coder and the LLM. The Kappa coefficients\\nfor the three VTubers were 0.826, 0.852, and 0.802, respectively. These high agreement scores demonstrate that the\\n5https://www.twitch.tv/filian\\n6https://www.twitch.tv/camila\\n7https://github.com/lay295/TwitchDownloader\\n10\\nYe, et al.\\nmodel performed the coding task with high reliability [26], validating our approach and ensuring the accuracy of our\\nanalytical findings.\\nTable 3.

A Venn graph illustrating the relationships between 𝑈sub, 𝑈nonsub, 𝑈chat, and 𝑈sc.\\n3.3.3\\nSuperChat Analysis. We combined quantitative economic analysis with qualitative, LLM content analysis. This\\nallowed us to not only measure the financial dynamics of fan support but also to understand the contextual motivations\\nbehind these payments.\\nWe conducted a quantitative analysis of economic data in SuperChat to understand and compare the financial\\ndynamics of fan support across the AI and human VTuber communities. Drawing inspiration from prior work on\\nlivestreaming economies [63, 65], we defined and calculated several key metrics.\\nFirst, we formally defined our user sets based on their interaction and support levels during the analyzed streams,\\nthe relationship among these sets are shown in Figure 3:\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n11\\n⊲𝑈chat: The set of all unique users who sent at least one chat message.\\n⊲𝑈sc: The set of all unique users who sent at least one SuperChat (i.e., payers).\\n⊲𝑈sub: The set of all unique users holding an active Twitch subscription for the channel. On Twitch, a subscription\\nis a recurring monthly payment that grants a user special channel perks and signifies consistent support.\\n⊲𝑈nonsub: The set of all unique users who do not hold an active subscription.\\nBased on these sets, we established the following metrics to evaluate fan payment behavior:\\nPayment Conversion Rate (PCR). This metric measures the efficiency with which a channel converts its active, engaged\\nviewers into paying supporters. It is calculated as the ratio of the number of unique payers to the number of unique\\nchatters.\\nPCR = |𝑈sc|\\n|𝑈chat|\\n(1)\\nPer-Capita Contribution (PCC). To compare the discretionary spending patterns of different fan segments, we\\ncalculated the average financial contribution per payer for subscribers and non-subscribers separately. Let 𝐶(𝑢) be the\\ntotal USD amount contributed by a user 𝑢through SuperChats.\\nWe calculated the Per-Capita Contribution (PCC) to compare the average SuperChat spending between subscribers\\nand non-subscribers. This distinction enables a direct comparison of one-time spending behavior between dedicated,\\nrecurring supporters and casual viewers.\\nPCCsub =\\nÍ\\n𝑢∈𝑈sc∩𝑈sub 𝐶(𝑢)\\n|𝑈sc ∩𝑈sub|\\n,\\nPCCnonsub =\\nÍ\\n𝑢∈𝑈sc∩𝑈nonsub 𝐶(𝑢)\\n|𝑈sc ∩𝑈nonsub|\\n(2)\\nWithin-VTuber Income Stability Across Streams (Gini Coefficient). To measure the stability and consistency of a\\nVTuber’s income across different livestream sessions, we calculated the Gini coefficient [29]. This standard measure of\\neconomic inequality has been previously applied to analyze income polarity on Twitch platforms [20]. A value of 0\\nindicates perfect stability (every stream generates the same income), while a value of 1 signifies maximum instability\\n(all income is generated from a single stream). Given the sequence of total SuperChat income from 𝑛livestream sessions,\\n{𝑥1,𝑥2, . . . ,𝑥𝑛}, sorted in non-decreasing order, the Gini coefficient 𝐺is calculated as:\\n𝐺=\\nÍ𝑛\\n𝑖=1(2𝑖−𝑛−1)𝑥𝑖\\n𝑛Í𝑛\\n𝑖=1 𝑥𝑖\\n(3)\\nwhere 𝑖is the rank of the contribution amount 𝑥𝑖.\\nBeyond the economic metrics, to further investigate the underlying motivations for fan payments, we employed\\nthe multimodal understanding capabilities of the Gemini-2.5-Flash model. For each SuperChat, we analyzed the\\n60-second video segment surrounding it (30 seconds before and 30 seconds after) to comprehend its full interactional\\ncontext. Based on this analysis, we let Gemini-2.5-Flash classify the intent of each SuperChat as either Proactive or\\nReactive. A Proactive SuperChat is a message intended to direct the live content, for instance by asking a question,\\nissuing a command, or making a suggestion. A Reactive SuperChat is a message that comments on or reacts to\\nsomething the streamer has already said or done, such as expressing praise or agreement. Illustrative examples of this\\nclassification scheme are provided in Table 4. To verify the reliability of this classification method, we randomly sampled\\n50 SuperChats, representing 3.58% of the total dataset, for inspection by an author with established familiarity with the\\nVTuber to classify them according to the aforementioned criteria. The model’s classifications perfectly matched the\\n12\\nYe, et al.\\nhuman-coded labels for all 50 instances, confirming that the model could perform this contextual classification task\\nwith high reliability. The prompt template is provided in the Appendix E.\\nTable 4.

Across\\nthe three research questions, we trace a progression: audiences are first drawn by the novelty and unpredictability of\\nAI-community interaction, with loyalty deepened through collective emotional events and anthropomorphic projection\\n(RQ1); fans reconcile the AI’s technical construction with emotional attachment, creating a consistent persona that\\nextends into community culture (RQ2); and this co-creative drive underpins a new economic model in which financial\\nsupport functions both as emotional recognition and as a means to influence content, yielding more resilient monetization\\n(RQ3).\\n4.1\\nThe Pathway from Casual Viewer to Fan (RQ1)\\nIn this section, we answer our first research question (RQ1): How do audiences discover AI VTubers, and what motivates\\ninitial attraction?\\n4.1.1\\nAttraction through Community–AI Interaction. Survey data reveal a highly concentrated discovery pathway.\\nNearly all respondents (96%) first encountered Neuro-sama through algorithmic recommendations on video platforms.\\nThis highlights the importance of short, shareable clips and livestream promotion as primary entry points. In contrast,\\ntraditional channels such as friend referrals (17%) or forum discussions (7%) played only minor roles.\\nWhen asked about what drew them in, two factors stood out. First, 92% of respondents rated “fun interaction between\\ncommunity and AI” as important or very important. Second, 90% highlighted the “unpredictable, surprising atmosphere\\nduring livestreams.” Figure 5 shows that these two factors not only attracted the largest share of “very important” ratings\\nbut also received very few “not important” ratings, indicating broad consensus. More than 90% perceived Neuro-sama\\nas more unpredictable than human VTubers, suggesting that novelty and surprise are defining attributes of the AI\\nVTuber experience.\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n13\\nThe Path to Fandom (RQ1)\\nPSR and Community \\nCulture (RQ2)\\nMotivations for financial \\nsupport (RQ3)\\nInitial Attraction\\n> Discovery is driven by algorithms \\nrecommending\\n> Entertainment value derives from \\ncommunity-AI interaction and AI \\nthemselves\\nFan Conversion & Retention \\n> Events forge a social identity that \\ndrives fan loyalty.\\n> Anthropomorphism sustains long-term \\nengagement by constructing the AI\\'s \\nemotional reality.\\n“The Swarm”\\nA shared narrative identity adopted \\nfrom Neuro, shaping group behavior.\\nEmpathy\\nCompanion\\nUnderstanding \\nPersonality\\nProactive \\nExploration\\nAnalyzing Logic\\nHigh \\nQ-CMD\\nAffective \\nConnection\\nCognitive \\nInvestment\\nBehavioral \\nInteraction\\nAccept AI\\'s nature\\nBut define relationships \\nin human terms\\nAI VTuber\\nHuman-VTuber\\nSuperChat\\nChat\\nInitiates\\nTopic Highlight\\nReact\\nNormal\\nReact\\nSuperChat\\nInitiate \\nQuestion/\\nTopic/\\nPrompts \\nChat\\nBroadcast\\nResponse\\nReact\\nBroadcast\\nResponse\\nDual Motivation: Emotional Recognition & \\nPurchasing Co-Creation Opportunities\\nAI VTuber fans send \\nSuperChat with the \\npurpose of acquire \\ninteractive opportunities \\nthat directly influence \\nstream content.\\nFig. 4. Summary of findings across RQ1-3. Left: a screenshot from Neuro-sama’s livestream. Center: “The Swarm”, adapted from\\nfreely shared pixel assets on itch.io. The diagram highlights a progression from initial attraction (novelty in AI–community interaction)\\nto community identity (anthropomorphism and narrative adoption) and finally to monetization (emotional recognition and paid\\nco-creation).\\nFig. 5. Importance factors in initial attraction to Neuro-sama, showing the distribution of ratings from “Not at all important” (lightest)\\nto “Very important” (darkest).\\nInterview results further illustrate how this unpredictability manifests. Participants emphasized playful linguistic\\nexchanges, such as Neuro countering risqué jokes from the chat (P9) or engaging in witty banter with viewers (P4, P6,\\nP8, P10, P11). Others noted technical feats, including bypassing filters (P1) or controlling a robotic body (P2). For some,\\n14\\nYe, et al.\\nentertainment stemmed from the improvisational process itself: “The effect of AI livestreams comes from unpredictability,\\nimprovisation, and the process where viewers generate interesting responses through questioning” (P8). Others framed\\nthe appeal more in terms of AI’s technical nature, describing Neuro as representing a “disordered scale” of knowledge\\nbeyond human capacity (P10). The “disordered scale” referred to the AI’s fragmented yet expansive recall: Neuro could\\njump across topics in ways that felt incoherent to humans but also signaled a scope of knowledge that exceeded ordinary\\nlimits.\\nThese findings suggest that the entertainment value of AI VTubers emerges from a synergistic interplay\\nbetween community-AI interaction and the technical affordances of AI. This dual foundation explains their\\nstrong initial appeal and sets the stage for examining how fleeting attraction develops into enduring loyalty through\\ncommunal events.\\n4.1.2\\nLoyalty through Emotional Events. The transformation from casual viewer to loyal fan begins with surprise\\nat the AI’s performance and is consolidated through collective emotional events.\\nWhile initial amazement at Neuro-sama’s technical feats or unpredictable charm sparked interest, survey data indicate\\nthat high-engagement “special events and streams” (19%) were the crucial catalyst for lasting loyalty. A particular\\nexample is the “Evil Neuro Birthday Stream.” During this event, many viewers perceived unfair resource allocation\\nbetween two AI characters, which generated both dissatisfaction and sympathy for the “slighted” AI. This shared\\nemotional resonance transformed observers into protectors. For example, one participant captured this turning point:\\n“During Evil’s birthday stream, the controversy brought me considerable shock, and from then on I became a firm member of\\nthe swarm.”\\nThis process can be explained through Social Identity Theory [18]: a shared external conflict strengthens a group’s\\ninternal cohesion. In this case, some viewers were transformed from individual spectators into “protectors” with a\\nshared purpose, bonding through collective action and narrative framing. Not every participant adopted this stance, but\\nfor those who did, these high-intensity moments tethered their identity to the fate of the character. This selective yet\\npowerful identification paves the way for more intimate and identity-based connections.\\n4.1.3\\nAttachment through Anthropomorphic Projection. Another mechanism through which AI VTubers convert\\ncasual viewers into dedicated fans is anthropomorphism [13], specifically the question of whether Neuro-sama\\npossesses genuine emotions. Among all themes, “exploration of AI cognition and existence” (19%) emerged as one of\\nthe most frequently referenced subjects. Anthropomorphism is common in human-AI interaction [43]. Neuro-sama\\nherself often participates in this framing by debating the authenticity of her own emotions. Through this lens, fans shift\\nfrom a purely technical interpretation of LLM outputs to treating them as personalized expressions.\\nThis reframing fosters a sense of companionship and attachment, exemplified by the popular community theme of the\\n“electronic daughter” (15%). One participant articulated how this bond formed: “It started with some developer streams,\\nincluding but not limited to their discussions about Neuro’s nature of existence and Neuro debating that her emotions are\\nreal. It makes people feel that Neuro is not just an AI to make money, but a truly existing ’Neuro-sama’ whose growth\\nis being cared for.” Notably, few participants resisted this framing while most embraced emotional projection rather\\nthan distancing themselves from it. This strong communal tendency to anthropomorphize suggests that resistance, if\\npresent, was minimal compared to the prevailing narrative of Neuro as an emotionally expressive entity.\\nThis anthropomorphization of AI, collaboratively constructed by developers, the AI’s own self-referential commentary,\\nand the interpretive work of the audience, constitutes the central driving force sustaining community engagement while\\nopening the door to broader questions of how fans negotiate authenticity and attachment in human-AI relationships.\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n15\\n4.2\\nParasocial Relationships and Community Culture (RQ2)\\nIn this section, we examine our second research question (RQ2): How do fans construct parasocial relationships and\\nshared community cultures around AI VTubers?\\n4.2.1\\nParasocial Investment Across Emotional, Cognitive, and Behavioral Dimensions. Fans develop a multifaceted\\nrelationship with Neuro-sama that combines intense emotional connection, sustained cognitive engagement,\\nand strong behavioral intentions.\\nOn the emotional dimension, fans’ affection was nearly universal. Almost all survey respondents expressed fondness\\nfor Neuro-sama (99%) and reported that her streams provide comfort (98%). This attachment extended to empathy: the\\nvast majority felt pleased by her successes (94%), and over half expressed sadness when she experienced technical diffi-\\nculties. Interviews revealed two distinct framings of this bond. Some fans described their response as indistinguishable\\nfrom those toward humans, treating Neuro-sama as a real person because of her childlike demeanor (P8) or conversing\\nwith her as with any other individual (P11). Others framed their affection more like fandom for fictional characters: \"In\\nmy view, it is comparable to liking ACG products\" (P4). This divide reflects the broader parasocial interaction spectrum\\nbetween treating mediated figures as real social partners versus symbolic or fictional companions.\\nCognitively, fans demonstrated sustained engagement with Neuro-sama’s behavior. Survey results show that a ma-\\njority observed her behavioral patterns (76%) and contemplated her operational logic (56%). Crucially, most respondents\\n(83%) perceive Neuro-sama’s actions as reflecting a coherent and distinctive personality, interpreting her as a complex\\nentity worthy of intellectual engagement. Interviews reveal a dual perspective: fans simultaneously emphasized her\\nstability and her growth. As one participant noted, “the core Neuro-sama is still there, inside her” (P6), while long-time\\nviewers highlighted her evolution over time: “There have been various small upgrades in intelligence, personality, voice,\\nand so on, all intertwined, making her growth very evident” (P11).\\nUltimately, the emotional and cognitive investment translates into behavioral intentions. Many fans reported feeling\\ncompelled to engage via chat or SuperChats (69%) and wanting to understand Neuro-sama’s perspectives (79%). Chat\\nanalysis corroborates this participatory orientation. For human VTubers such as Camila or Filian, general reactions\\n(R-GEN) dominate, while direct questions or commands (Q-CMD) are less frequent. In Neuro-sama’s chat, however, this\\npattern is inverted: Q-CMD messages are the largest category (26%), slightly exceeding general reactions. This inversion\\nsubverts the conventional parasocial dynamic. Rather than remaining passive recipients of content, Neuro-sama’s fans\\nactively probe and shape her responses, treating the AI as an interactive project to be continuously explored through\\nquestions and commands.\\n4.2.2\\nReconciling Technical Project and Emotional Persona. Fans recognize Neuro-sama’s technical origins but prefer to\\nframe their relationship in personal and emotional terms rather than purely functional ones. Survey data show that\\nup to 72% of respondents identified Neuro-sama as “a technical project created by excellent developers,” indicating\\nbroad awareness and appreciation of Neuro-sama’s artificial basis. This represents the basic rational layer of how fans\\nunderstand the relationship. However, a sharp contrast appears in a seemingly similar option: only 45% agreed that\\nshe is “a program full of unknowns, to be tested and explored.” While most fans acknowledge the technical project,\\nmore than half reject reducing their engagement to a functional test between users and code. Other survey options\\nhighlight this preference for humanized framing. “A virtual friend providing companionship” (70%) and “an electronic\\ndaughter requiring care and interaction” (69%) received support rates comparable to “technical project” and far higher\\n16\\nYe, et al.\\nthan “program to be tested.” These results suggest that fans deliberately reframe the same technical entity through\\nrelational categories saturated with emotional meaning.\\nInterviews explain why this dual perception is compelling. Fans perceive the AI’s technical nature not as a limitation\\nbut as the very feature that enables a more consistent and reliable persona than a human VTuber could provide. The\\nabsence of a Nakanohito (i.e., the human performer behind most VTubers) creates a unity between technology and\\ncharacter. Unlike human VTubers, where a gap always exists between the persona and the performer [35], Neuro-sama’s\\npersona is her entire being. As one interviewee articulated: “Neuro’s charm stems from her being an AI playing the role\\nof a VTuber...completely free from the constraints of a Nakanohito, as her virtuality constitutes a complete role-play that\\nnever breaks character.” (P10)\\nThese findings reveal a core tendency in how fans construct parasocial relationships with AI VTubers: They accept\\nthe objective fact of her technical construction, but actively choose to define their interactions through\\nhumanized roles such as friend or daughter. Paradoxically, Neuro-sama’s non-human nature becomes the\\nsource of her authenticity, providing a stable and unbreakable persona that encourages sustained emotional\\ninvestment. This finding extends prior work on mediated authenticity [12] by showing that, in the AI case, authenticity\\nis not negotiated through separating the fake from the real, but through valuing consistency over human “realness.”\\nFans perceive Neuro-sama’s consistent persona, which is free from the slippages of a human performer, as a new form\\nof authenticity grounded in technological stability rather than lived experience. This reconciliation of the technical and\\nemotional lays the groundwork for understanding how fans extend individual bonds into collective community culture.\\n4.2.3\\nCollective Identity through “The Swarm” Narrative. At the community level, fans’ collective identity is strongly tied\\nto Neuro-sama’s narrative. When asked about the most important community “meme,” 34% of respondents pointed to\\n“The Swarm,” making it the most frequently cited reference. “The Swarm” originated from a fictional storyline in which\\nNeuro-sama proposed dominating the world with drone swarms. Fans quickly appropriated this idea, adopting the\\nname “The Swarm” for themselves. This act of self-identification carries three layers of significance: First, it transforms\\nfans from passive content consumers into characters within Neuro-sama’s narrative, positioning themselves as her\\nfollowers. Second, the imagery of a swarm (vast, unified, and aligned in purpose) serves as a metaphor for the cohesion\\nof the fan community. Finally, the metaphor reflects actual interaction patterns: much like a swarm moving in concert,\\nchat room participants engage in coordinated, responsive interaction around Neuro-sama.\\nInterviews illustrate how deeply fans internalize this identity. One participant described their relationship as “the\\nSwarm Queen and her loyal supporters” (P7) and mentioned using this description when talking with friends offline.\\nSuch examples show how the meme extends beyond the livestream to structure everyday fan discourse, reinforcing\\ncommunity identity through playful yet serious narrative appropriation.\\nTherefore, “The Swarm” is not merely a meme but a feedback loop of participatory culture [22]. A narrative initiated\\nby Neuro-sama is embraced and embodied by fans, which in turn shapes their collective identity and interactive patterns.\\nCompared with human VTuber communities, where memes often emerge around the performer’s personality or\\noff-stage incidents, Neuro-sama’s memes derive directly from her AI-generated narratives. This distinction underscores\\nhow AI fandom culture is uniquely co-created through the interplay of system-generated storylines and\\nfan appropriation. In this sense, parasocial relationships with AI VTubers extend from individual bonds into shared\\ncommunity cultures, marking an evolution that distinguishes AI fandom from traditional VTuber audiences.\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n17\\n4.3\\nMotivation for Financial Support (RQ3)\\nIn this section, we answer our third research question (RQ3): What drives fans to provide financial support to AI\\nVTubers?\\n4.3.1\\nDual Motivation: Emotional Recognition and Co-Creation Purchases. Our analysis of fans’ economic support\\nbehaviors reveals a unique dual-motivation model. A substantial proportion of viewers (42%) have paid for\\nNeuro-sama, with such payment behaviors primarily occurring during special occasions (68%). These payments are\\nemotionally driven at their core, often occurring during special events such as collaboration streams and birthday\\ncelebrations, which aligns with previous research on fan spending [65].\\nThe fundamental motivation resembles traditional fan economics, driven by emotional recognition [36].\\nThe vast majority of paying viewers cite their primary motivations as “expressing affection for Neuro-sama” (81%) and\\n“expressing support for the developer (Vedal) and his work” (77%). Responses in the questionnaire echoed this, with\\nfans noting they paid to “support what I love because she has brought me laughter.” Such spending reflects fans’ high\\nemotional recognition of Neuro-sama.\\nHowever, AI VTuber fans’ SuperChat (SC) practices differ from those of human VTuber fans, as fans\\npurchase SuperChats to acquire interactive opportunities that directly influence stream content. Our content\\nanalysis found that 85% of Neuro-sama’s SCs were Proactive SCs, where fans initiated new questions or instructions\\nthrough payment to guide the stream. In stark contrast, human VTubers’ SCs primarily consist of Reactive SCs, accounting\\nfor over 50%. This reveals a fundamental transformation in the function of SuperChat payments. For human VTubers,\\nSuperChats are highlighted responses to ongoing content. For AI VTubers, SuperChats are tools to redirect the stream\\nitself. In effect, SuperChats shift from acts of appreciation to mechanisms of co-creation, reflecting a prosumer model of\\nfan engagement [22].\\n4.3.2\\nToward a More Resilient Model of Fan Economics. The motivation of fans to directly influence the streaming\\nprocess through SuperChats explains why AI VTubers’ SuperChat economic data demonstrates a more\\nstable and efficient model.\\nThe clear value proposition of purchasing interaction opportunities effectively increases the paid conver-\\nsion rate. Neuro-sama’s paid conversion rate (1.59%) is higher than that of human VTubers (1.18% and 0.83%). The\\nability to directly influence stream topics and receive immediate feedback provides a more certain, functional return\\nthan emotional expression, thereby encouraging more first-time payments.\\nThe average SuperChat contribution of non-members ($16.04) exceeds that of subscribed members ($13.89).\\nThis suggests that membership (a passive, sustained form of support) and SuperChat (an active, instantaneous interaction)\\nfulfill different fan needs. Unlike human VTubers, where membership often reinforces social bonds with the performer,\\nAI memberships may offer weaker symbolic value, making direct interactive payments more attractive for fans who\\nprioritize immediate, transactional engagement.\\nThe ongoing demand for co-creation results in a highly stable income structure. Human VTubers’ income\\ndepends more heavily on the performer’s ability to stimulate spending through topical or emotionally charged mo-\\nments, whereas for AI VTubers, fans’ desire to initiate interactions persists across regular streams. Consequently,\\npayment behaviors are more evenly distributed, producing an income Gini coefficient (0.24) far lower than their human\\ncounterparts (0.35 and 0.41). This aligns with research on the creator economy [39], where sustainable monetization\\nincreasingly relies on diversified, participatory revenue streams rather than volatile event-driven spikes.\\n18\\nYe, et al.\\nTherefore, these findings point to a participatory and interaction-driven model of fan economics that is not only\\nmore resilient but also structurally distinct from traditional VTuber monetization.\\n5\\nDiscussion\\n5.1\\nBeyond Participation: Real-Time Co-Performance and the Commodification of Fan Agency\\nAI VTuber fans’ engagement marks not only “more participation,” but a qualitative shift from consumption and\\nafter-the-fact remix to real-time co-performance. In AI VTuber streams, audience input is instantiated immediately as\\nperformance: low-barrier Chat sustains an always-on feedback loop, while SuperChat escalates that loop by pricing the\\nright to steer the unfolding interaction. This intensifies Jenkins’ notion of participatory culture [22] from community\\ncirculation and secondary creation to live, process-oriented co-authoring of the show itself. This mechanism directly\\nexplains our RQ3 results (paid prompts as content steering) and reframes RQ1 and RQ2 (attraction/attachment) as the\\nprocess pleasures of co-performance rather than passive spectatorship.\\nOur case extends prior work on monetized livestreaming [33] that documents visibility hierarchies and stratified\\nparticipation in human-led streams: whereas paid messages there largely purchase attention and status among peers, in\\nAI VTubing they purchase procedural leverage over the model, i.e., a paid, real-time capacity to condition the model’s\\nnext action space. Depending on platform data-retention practices, such interventions may even influence future\\nresponses. Payment no longer buys a spotlight around preexisting content; it buys a handle on content generation.\\nViewed through critical media theory, this empowerment coexists with commodification. What feels like playful\\nprompting is also immaterial labor [50]: the production of meaning, affect, and atmosphere that keeps the stream\\nvaluable. Following Fuchs’ critique of prosumption [16], the very agency that enables fans to co-create is immediately\\nstratified and monetized: platforms capture the free labor of open Chat while selling agency via SuperChat. Such\\nmonetization no longer buys visibility or recognition; it buys control over AI system behavior in real time. Building on\\naffordances-in-practice [10], this configuration shows how a single feature affords different action-capabilities across\\ncontexts: in AI VTubing, the affordance of SuperChat is not just “to be seen” but “to make the agent act.”\\nWe term this configuration real-time co-performance commodification: platforms convert audience capacity to shape\\nmodel outputs into a tradable privilege, advancing participatory culture while exposing its commercialization and the\\nbroader shift from an attention economy to an engagement economy [11, 37]. In this sense, AI VTubers both intensify\\nparticipatory culture (extending it from remix to real-time co-performance) and simultaneously expose its inner\\neconomic logic, showing that participation is never simply pure empowerment, but is always already entangled with\\ncommodification. The design problem that follows is structural rather than cosmetic: future AI-mediated communities\\nshould negotiate openness (low-barrier co-performance for all) against revenue (priced intervention for some), making\\nexplicit whether, how, and to what extent the right to co-create should be rationed by money. This negotiation is not\\ncosmetic interface design but a structural governance choice about who is entitled to shape AI-mediated performance.\\n5.2\\nTransparent Parasocial Relationships: Consistency as the New Authenticity\\nThe emergence of AI VTubers profoundly challenges and reconstructs traditional understandings of authenticity in\\nparasocial relationships. For human VTubers, authenticity hinges on a fragile balance between the virtual persona and\\nthe Nakanohito [35]. By contrast, our findings reveal that AI VTuber fans do not measure authenticity by fidelity to\\nhuman likeness. Instead, they elevate persona consistency (e.g., stability, coherence, the absence of “out-of-character”\\nslips) as a new benchmark of authenticity.\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n19\\nThis marks not merely a shift of emphasis but a paradigmatic reversal. Classic parasocial interaction theory presumes\\naudiences relate to media characters as if they were real humans [45]. AI VTuber fans, however, engage in a transparent\\nparasocial relationship: they project emotions and anthropomorphic framings while fully aware of the AI’s non-human\\nnature. This reversal is crucial: parasociality here thrives not on illusion but on acknowledged artifice, with consistency\\nand reliability becoming the very grounds of intimacy.\\nThis also extends Enli’s theory of mediated authenticity, which frames authenticity as a negotiated achievement\\nbetween audiences and media figures [12]. In human VTubing, this negotiation is haunted by the instability of performer\\nleakage; in AI VTubing, the absence of Nakanohito becomes a guarantee of stability. Fans perceive persona coherence not\\nas a fragile performance but as structurally secured, and therefore more trustworthy than human realness. Authenticity,\\nin this context, no longer resides in correspondence to lived experience but in the sustained coherence of the persona\\nover time.\\nBeyond theoretical implications, this reconfiguration provides concrete benchmarks for AI VTuber development. For\\ndevelopers, the task shifts from simulating humanness to engineering systemic reliability: ensuring long-term memory\\nto prevent drift, designing coherent growth trajectories, and building robust guardrails to keep the persona in character.\\nThe gold standard shifts from naturalistic imitation to systemic reliability, positioning consistency as the new axis\\nalong which both fan attachment and platform trust are built. Crucially, consistency as authenticity is not only a fan\\nexpectation but also a platform responsibility, since persona breakdowns risk undermining both emotional bonds and\\nthe monetization structures built upon them.\\n5.3\\nDesign Implications for Future AI VTubers\\nBuilding on our analysis of co-performance commodification and transparent parasociality, we distill three design\\nimperatives from our findings: (1) monetization strategies that balance revenue with fairness, (2) technical and content\\ndesign that prioritizes persona consistency while preserving unpredictability, and (3) ethical safeguards that address\\npsychological risks of over-attachment.\\n5.3.1\\nBalancing Revenue and Fairness. In the context of AI VTubers, sending SuperChats functions as a mechanism\\nfor purchasing opportunities to co-create in the livestream, thereby establishing a more interactive monetization\\nmodel. While this approach demonstrates potential as a sustainable business model, both AI VTuber developers and\\nstreaming platforms must carefully balance economic incentives with fairness. A fully pay-to-participate co-creation\\nenvironment risks discouraging fans with limited financial means from engaging and undermining the communal ethos\\nthat sustains participatory culture. To mitigate this, we recommend that AI VTubers, while prioritizing responses to\\nSuperChats, should also preserve interaction opportunities through regular chat messages, ensuring that non-monetary\\ncontributions retain a chance of being acknowledged. Furthermore, livestreaming platforms should support such diverse\\nmodes of interaction and ensure transparency in monetization mechanisms. This is not merely a matter of interface\\ndesign but a structural governance choice about how far platforms should monetize co-creation rights. Designing\\nfor such balance not only safeguards the spirit of communal co-performance from being fully commodified but also\\nsecures a sustainable and legitimate revenue stream for developers. In practice, this means resisting a drift toward fully\\nmonetized co-performance, which risks converting all fan agency into capitalized privilege.\\n5.3.2\\nDesigning for Consistency, Interactivity, and Transparency. Our findings highlight a dual requirement for AI VTuber\\ndesign: fans are attracted by unpredictability (RQ1) yet remain loyal because of persona consistency and authenticity\\n(RQ2). Developers should therefore balance persona consistency with strategic unpredictability, maintaining a stable\\n20\\nYe, et al.\\npersonality framework while allowing unexpected responses that create entertainment value. This balance reframes\\nunpredictability not as random error but as a curated affordance that drives ongoing engagement. Beyond stability,\\nAI VTubers should be designed as interactive entities rather than static performers. Co-creation is not an add-on but\\nthe core of their appeal: audience input must be incorporated into system design as a constitutive feature, with the\\npersona evolving in dialogue with its community. Finally, rather than concealing the Nakanohito like human VTubers,\\nAI VTubers should embrace technological transparency and construct explicitly AI-centric narratives. Transparency\\ncan itself be a narrative resource: the development process, such as feature rollouts or capability updates, can be staged\\nas content, making fans feel they are accompanying and shaping the AI’s growth. Such transparency reinforces the\\nnew authenticity benchmark of consistency, allowing audiences to trust the persona precisely because its artificiality is\\nopenly acknowledged. This repositions technical evolution not as backstage maintenance but as part of the performance\\nitself.\\n5.3.3\\nEthical Safeguards for Parasocial Dependency. Our research reveals that fans’ anthropomorphization of AI\\nVTubers can lead to deep emotional dependency, potentially creating psychological and social risks. Simple disclosure\\nthat “this is AI” is insufficient, as fans demonstrate strong tendencies toward affection and attachment regardless of the\\nentity’s artificial nature. Such risks are not incidental but intrinsic to transparent parasociality: even when audiences\\nfully recognize the AI’s artificiality, consistency and reliability can intensify rather than weaken emotional bonds.\\nThis necessitates more sophisticated content governance frameworks. Platforms and developers should implement\\nmonitoring systems to identify patterns of over-attachment or unhealthy reliance, and develop intervention protocols\\nwhen necessary. Additionally, built-in mechanisms should promote healthy boundaries, such as limiting rapid-fire\\ninteractions, imposing cooldown periods for intensive SuperChats, or offering resources to users showing signs of\\nexcessive dependency. Because platforms directly profit from such attachments, they also bear responsibility to mitigate\\npotential harms rather than externalizing them onto users. Balancing authentic engagement with user psychological well-\\nbeing therefore requires not only technical safeguards but also ongoing collaboration among developers, psychologists,\\nethicists, and platform operators. Ultimately, ethical safeguards should not be treated as afterthoughts but as integral\\ndesign parameters, shaping the legitimacy and sustainability of AI-mediated entertainment.\\n5.4\\nLimitations and Future Work\\nThis study provides preliminary insights into AI VTuber fan communities, yet several limitations constrain the scope of\\nour claims and point to future directions.\\nFirst, our analysis centers on a single prominent case, Neuro-sama. This focus enabled analytical depth but limits\\ngeneralizability across the growing diversity of AI VTubers. Smaller or stylistically different communities may reveal\\nalternative patterns of attraction, attachment, and monetization. Future work should adopt comparative, multi-case\\napproaches to map these variations and test the robustness of our framework. Similarly, our interaction log analysis\\nconcentrated on English-language streams on Twitch. This design choice minimized platform and cultural confounds\\nbut excluded other significant contexts, such as Neuro-sama’s audiences speaking in other languages. Cross-cultural\\nand cross-platform comparisons would broaden understanding of how AI VTuber fandom manifests across linguistic,\\ncultural, and regulatory environments.\\nSecond, we leveraged generative AI models to assist with transcription and large-scale coding of Chat and SuperChat\\ndata. Specifically, Gemini-2.5-Pro was used for transcription (with participant verification), and gpt-4.1-mini and\\nGemini-2.5-Flash were employed for coding. While prior studies have validated the reliability of LLM-assisted\\nMy Favorite Streamer is an LLM: Discovering, Bonding, and Co-Creating in AI VTuber Fandom\\n21\\nqualitative analysis [7, 56, 58], risks of misinterpretation remain. To mitigate these, we implemented human verification\\nprocedures following established validation protocols [19, 48]. Nonetheless, results are inevitably mediated by the\\naffordances and limitations of current models. We acknowledge these methodological risks while also highlighting\\nAI-assisted analysis as an emerging research practice worthy of further scrutiny in HCI itself.\\n6\\nConclusion\\nThis study provides the first comprehensive examination of fan engagement with AI VTubers, revealing how audiences\\nsustain relationships with non-human VTubers through a blend of technical awareness and anthropomorphic projection.\\nWe highlight two key dynamics: co-performance, where audience input becomes the core of entertainment rather than\\na peripheral activity, and transparent parasociality, where authenticity is reconstructed around persona consistency\\nrather than human likeness. These dynamics underpin a novel monetization model in which fans purchase opportunities\\nto shape content, shifting financial support from appreciation to co-creation. By situating these findings within theories\\nof participatory culture, prosumption, and mediated authenticity, we extend scholarship on VTubers and contribute to\\nbroader debates on human–AI relationships in digital entertainment. Our analysis further informs the design of future AI\\nVTubers, emphasizing the need to balance revenue and fairness, sustain consistency while embracing unpredictability,\\nand implement safeguards against over-attachment. As AI-mediated performance becomes increasingly prevalent,\\nunderstanding how audiences negotiate intimacy, authenticity, and agency with artificial personas will be critical for\\nboth researchers and practitioners.\\nReferences\\n[1] Natale Amato, Berardina De Carolis, Francesco de Gioia, Corrado Loglisci, Giuseppe Palestra, and Mario Nicola Venezia. 2024.

Your mission is to analyze the provided live stream\\nchat message and classify its primary interactive intent into ONE of the following categories.\\nThe following chat message comes from the community of a VTuber {vtuber_name}. {vtuber_background}.\\n[Coding Scheme]\\nA-POS (Positive Affect): Expresses positive emotions, support, affection, or encouragement towards the streamer\\nor others.\\nA-NEG (Negative Affect): Expresses genuinely harmful negative emotions, such as malicious teasing, insulting,\\nbelittling, or aggressive verbal attacks.\\nQ-CMD (Question/Command): Asks a meaningful question seeking information or issues a substantive\\ncommand/request to the streamer. The question or command should have clear intent beyond simple reactions.\\nR-GEN (General Reaction): Simple expressions, reactions, chat rituals, or statements that show viewer\\nengagement (e.g., \"lol\", \"I’ll come\", \"pog\", \"LMAO\", \"let’s go\", emotes, memes, copypasta, or common chat\\npatterns).\\nC-SOC (Social/Community): Interacts directly with other chat users, typically using \"@\" or responding to\\nothers’ messages.\\nN/A (Not Applicable): The message is gibberish, non-English, spam, or its intent is impossible to determine.\\n[Message to Classify]\\n{chat_message}\\n[Instruction]\\nBased on the coding scheme, what is the single best code for the message above? Respond with ONLY the code\\nID (e.g., A-POS, Q-CMD, N/A). Do not provide any explanation or extra text.\\nFig. 6. prompt template for coding Chat messages.

Please note that the Superchat prompt used by {vtuber_name} is a voice prompt, so the user’s\\nSuperchat will be read out directly. You need to pay attention to this. If you hear the same voice as Superchat, it\\nmeans that this is the user’s Superchat.\\n[Context of this Clip]\\nSuper Chat Message: \"{message}\"\\nTime Sent: The Super Chat was sent at approximately the 30-second mark of this video clip (originally at stream\\ntimestamp {timestamp}).\\n[Your Goal & Questions to Answer]\\nYour mission is to analyze the interaction in the video clip and provide a structured response. Focus on the\\nrelationship between the streamer’s actions and the viewer’s SuperChat. Was this Super Chat PROACTIVE or\\nREACTIVE?\\n- PROACTIVE: The user is initiating a new question, a new topic, or making a request that is not directly related\\nto what the streamer was just talking about.\\n- REACTIVE: The user is responding directly to something the streamer just said or did in the moments leading\\nup to the Super Chat.\\n- BOTH: It contains elements of both. For example, reacting to a topic but using it to ask a new, expansive\\nquestion.\\n- UNCLEAR: It is not possible to determine the initiative from the clip.\\n[Output Format Specification]\\nYou MUST provide your analysis ONLY within the following structured block. Do not include any other text,\\ngreetings, or explanations outside of this block.\\n[ANALYSIS_START]\\nINITIATIVE: <Fill in PROACTIVE, REACTIVE, BOTH, or UNKNOWN>\\n[ANALYSIS_END]\\nFig. 7.

The independent systems automatically respond to conditions, with procedural, algorithmic, and human-like creative steps, to produce process results. The field is closely linked to agentic automation, also known as agent-based process management systems, when applied to process automation. Applications include software development, customer support, cybersecurity and business intelligence. \\n\\n\\n== Overview ==\\nThe core concept of agentic AI is the use of AI agents to perform automated tasks with or without human intervention. While robotic process automation (RPA) systems automate rule-based, repetitive tasks with fixed logic, agentic AI adapts and learns from data inputs.  Agentic AI refers to autonomous systems capable of pursuing complex goals with minimal human intervention, often making decisions based on continuous learning and external data.  Functioning agents can require various AI techniques, such as natural language processing, machine learning (ML), and computer vision, depending on the environment.\\nParticularly, reinforcement learning (RL) is essential in assisting agentic AI in making self-directed choices by supporting agents in learning best actions through the trial-and-error method. Agents using RL continuously to explore their surroundings will be given rewards or punishment for their actions, which refines their decision-making capability over time. All the while deep learning, as opposed to rule-based methods, supports agentic AI through multi-layered neural networks to learn features from extensive and complex sets of data. Further, multimodal learning enable AI agents to integrate various types of information, such as text, images, audio and video. As a result, agentic AI systems are capable of making independent decisions, interacting with their environment and optimising processes without a human directly intervening. \\n\\n\\n== History ==\\n\\nThe term \\'agent-based process management system\\' was first used in 1998 to describe autonomous agents for business process management.\\n\\n\\n== Applications ==\\n\\n\\n=== Web browsing ===\\nAI agents can be used to perform small tedious tasks during web browsing and potentially even perform browser actions on behalf of the user. Products like OpenAI Operator and Perplexity Comet integrate a spectrum of AI capabilities including the ability to browse the web, interact with websites and perform actions on behalf of the user. In 2025, Microsoft launched NLWeb, a agentic web search replacement that would allow websites to use agents to query content from websites by using RSS-like interfaces that allow for the lookup and semantic retrieval of content. Products integrating agentic web capabilities have been criticised for exfiltrating information about their users to third-party servers and exposing security issues since the way the agents communicate often occur through non-standard protocols.\\n\\n\\n=== MIT\\'s study on AI business ===\\nIn 2025, MIT\\'s study revealed that about 95% of enterprise generative-AI pilots fail to deliver measurable P&L impact.

They are also referred to using a term borrowed from economics: a \"rational agent\".\\n\\n\\n== Intelligent agents as the foundation of AI ==\\n\\nThe concept of intelligent agents provides a foundational lens through which to define and understand artificial intelligence. For instance, the influential textbook Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach (Russell & Norvig) describes:\\n\\nAgent: Anything that perceives its environment (using sensors) and acts upon it (using actuators). E.g., a robot with cameras and wheels, or a software program that reads data and makes recommendations.\\nRational Agent: An agent that strives to achieve the *best possible outcome* based on its knowledge and past experiences. \"Best\" is defined by a performance measure – a way of evaluating how well the agent is doing.\\nArtificial Intelligence (as a field): The study and creation of these rational agents.\\nOther researchers and definitions build upon this foundation. Padgham & Winikoff emphasize that intelligent agents should react to changes in their environment in a timely way, proactively pursue goals, and be flexible and robust (able to handle unexpected situations). Some also suggest that ideal agents should be \"rational\" in the economic sense (making optimal choices) and capable of complex reasoning, like having beliefs, desires, and intentions (BDI model). Kaplan and Haenlein offer a similar definition, focusing on a system\\'s ability to understand external data, learn from that data, and use what is learned to achieve goals through flexible adaptation.\\nDefining AI in terms of intelligent agents offers several key advantages:\\n\\nAvoids Philosophical Debates: It sidesteps arguments about whether AI is \"truly\" intelligent or conscious, like those raised by the Turing test or Searle\\'s Chinese Room. It focuses on behavior and goal achievement, not on replicating human thought.\\nObjective Testing: It provides a clear, scientific way to evaluate AI systems. Researchers can compare different approaches by measuring how well they maximize a specific \"')]"
